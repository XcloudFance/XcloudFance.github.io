						### Recommendation Systems Overview
						A recommendation system consists of:
						1. Candidate generation
							- Generates a smaller subset of candidates from large corpus
							- E.g. YouTube candidate generator reduces billions of videos down to thousands

					</script>



				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					<script type="text/template">
					2. Scoring
						- Scores and ranks candidates in order
						- Selects a set of sorted items to display to user
					3. Re-ranking
						- Take into account additional constraints for final ranking
						- E.g. removing disliked items or boost fresher content

				<h3> Collaborative Filtering </h3>
				<p> Collaborative filtering uses similarities between users and items simultaneously to provide

			<section data-background="./assets/bg4.png">
				<section data-markdown>
					### Recommendations using Deep Neural Networks
					Collaborative filtering learn embeddings via matrix factorization. This method is limited in terms
					of:
					1. Hard to include side features
					2. Popular items tend to be recommended for everyone
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					**DNN models can address these limitations of matrix factorization**
					> easily incorporate query features and item features (due to the flexibility of the input layer of
					the network), which can help capture the specific interests of a user and improve the relevance of
					recommendations.
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					For the sake of time, we will not touch DNNs further. You can find out further
					[here](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/recommendation/dnn/softmax).
				</section>
			</section>

			<section data-background="./assets/bg3.png">
				<section data-markdown>
					### Retrieval
					After candidate generation (means that we have an embedding model), the system can do two (2) things
					at serve time:

				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					1. Matrix factorization - query embedding is known statically: Simply look up query embedding from
					embedding matrix
					2. DNN model - query embedding unknown: Simply compute query embedding at serve time (inference)
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					Now that we have:
					1. Query embedding, $q$ - represented by blue circle below;
					2. Item embeddings, $V_j$ - represented by green circle below;
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					then we can return top K items using similarity score $s(q, V_j)$.

					![Retrieval](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/recommendation/images/2Dretrieval.svg)

				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					### Scaling Up
					To find nearest neighbours, the system can exhaustively score every potential candidate - but it can
					be very expensive for large corpora. Possible workarounds:
					1. Statically-known query: Offline exhaustive scoring -> precompute and store list of top candidates
					2. Unknown query: Approximate nearest neightbour method
				</section>
			</section>

			<section>

			<section data-markdown data-background="./assets/bg1.png">
				## Scoring
				Generated candidates can come from multiple candidate generators using different sources:
				- Related items
				- User features
				- Geographic info
				- Popular or trending items
				- Social graph (liked or recommended by friends)

			</section>

	


			<section data-markdown>
				<script type="text/template">
1. These sources are combined into a common pool of candidates, like:
    - Get personalization info
    - Get trending items in respective area
2. Scored by single model and ranked according to score, like:
    - Model predict the probability of user watching a video using query and video features
    - Items ranked according to probability of watch
				</script>
			</section>


			<section data-markdown>
				<script type="text/template">
					### Objective Function for Scoring
					Choice of objective function can affect rankings and subsequently quality of recommendations:
					1. **Maximize click rate** - may recommend click-bait videos
					2. **Maximuze watch time** - may recommend very long videos
					3. **Increase diversity and maximize watch time** - may recommend short and engaging videos
					
				</script>
			</section>


		</section>
			<section data-markdown data-background="./assets/bg5.png">

				<section data-markdown>
					<script type="text/template">
					### Positional Bias in Scoring
					Items that appear lower on the screen are less likely to be clicked than items appearing higher on the screen. 

					
				</script>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					Querying the model with all possible positions is too expensive and the system still might not find
					a consistent ranking across multiple ranking scores:
					1. Create position-independent rankings
					2. Rank all candidates as if they are in the top position on the screen

				</section>

			</section>

			<section  data-background="./assets/bg1.png">
				<section data-markdown>
					## Re-ranking
					Re-ranking can improve the recommendations by considering additional criteria or constraints:
					
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					1. **Use filters to remove some candidates** - i.e. removing click-baits:
					- Training a separate model that detects whether a video is click-bait.
					- Running this model on the candidate list.
					- Removing the videos that the model classifies as click-bait.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					2. **Transform the score returned by the ranker** - i.e. modifying score:
					- As a function of video age (promote fresher content)
					- As a function of video length (increase viewing time)
				</section>
			</section>


			<section data-background="./assets/bg6.png">

				<section data-markdown>
					**So, What are the challenges?**
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					1. **Freshness**: Aim to incorporate the latest usage information, e.g. current user history and the
					newest items
					- Warm-start and re-run training as often as possible
					- Create an "average" user to represent new users in matrix factorization models
					- Use a DNN such as a softmax model or two-tower model
					- Add document age as a feature
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					2. **Diversity**: Lack of diversity can cause a bad or boring user experience
					- Train multiple candidate generators using different sources
					- Train multiple rankers using different objective functions
					- Re-rank items based on genre or other metadata


				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					3. **Fairness**: Treat all users fairly and reduce unconscious bias in data
					- Include diverse perspectives in design and development
					- Train ML models on comprehensive data sets and add auxilliary data when certain groups are
					underrepresented
					- Track metrics on each demographic to watch for biases
					- Make separate models for underserved groups
				</section>

			</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## Conclusion
				</section>


				<section data-markdown>
					1. Recommendations are the suggestions served up based on other things the user (e.g. you) like and
					they allow users to get in touch with compelling content in large corpora, particularly items that
					the user might not have thought to search for their own.
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					2. Recommendations can be performed via three (3) steps:
					- Candidate generation
					- Scoring
					- Re-ranking

				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					3. Items and queries can be represented using embeddings.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					4. Candidate generation is performed via:
					- Content-based filtering
					- Collaborative filtering (user or item-based)
					- Deep neural networks
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					5. Scoring can be performed for:
					- Maximizing click rate, but might promote click-baits
					- Maximuzing watch time, but might promote long videos
					- Both increase diversity and maximize watch time
				 </section>
				<section data-markdown>
					6. Re-ranking can be performed via:
					- Filtering to remove candidates - i.e. click-baits
					- Transformt the score - i.e. fresher content

					7. Challenges for a recommendation system:
					- Freshness of model
					- Diversity of content
					- Fairness for users
